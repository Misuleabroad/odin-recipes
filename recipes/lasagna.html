    <div class="steps"><h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 200C degrees.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes. 
        Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high.  Cook until the meat begins to brown, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. </li>
          <li>Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you want the lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding more sauce. Let the sauce continue to simmer. </li>
    <li>In a small bowl, stir together ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, egg, basil, salt, and pepper. </li>
    <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions. </li>
    <li>Spread the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking pan with 1/4 cup of the meat sauce. Place 3 noodles in a single layers on top of the sauce.  Spread each noodle with parmesan ricotta cheese filling and sprinkle with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese and meat sauce.  Repeat.  Finish with remaining mozzarella cheese. 
        <li>Spray a large piece of foil with non-stick cooking spray and cover the lasagna. Bake for 15 minutes and then remove the foil. Continue to bake until the cheese if bubbling, about 25 minutes longer. Cool the lasagna for 10 minutes before cutting into pieces. </li>
    </li>
